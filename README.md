# Hi, I'm Fidèle Tsognong 👋

**DevOps Engineer & Security Specialist** with 7 years of experience designing and developing scalable, secure applications. I specialize in **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**, **SIEM integration**, and **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**, helping organizations build robust security architectures for education and enterprise platforms.

I build secure, observable systems at [educosmic.tech](https://educosmic.tech) and contribute to open-source security and identity platforms.

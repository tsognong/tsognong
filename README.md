# Hi, I'm Fidèle Tsognong 👋

**Software Engineer & Security Enthusiast** focused on:

- Open‑source platforms: **Moodle**, **Odoo**, **Keycloak**, **Wazuh**, **ModSecurity**
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** and **Continuous SSO (CSSO)**
- **Observability / SIEM** for identity and application systems

I help institutions deploy, customize, and secure education and identity platforms, and I build education infrastructure at [educosmic.tech](https://educosmic.tech).

## 🔧 Core Skills

- **Languages:** Java, Golang, TypeScript, Python, Shell  
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot, React, Angular  
- **Security / IAM:** Keycloak, access control models (attribute/risk‑based), WAF (ModSecurity + OWASP CRS)

## 🏗 Selected Work

- **CSSO IAM Platform** – Continuous SSO with risk‑aware sessions, device/browser fingerprinting, adaptive auth, and full audit trails.  
  _Demo:_ [demo.csso-iam.com](https://demo.csso-iam.com)

- **Backup & Integrity Platform** – Golang + React web app for policy‑driven backups, integrity checks, and multi‑target storage.

- **Identity Log Observability** – Wazuh rules and decoders for Keycloak/Shibboleth to correlate auth flows with SIEM alerts.
